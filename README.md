# CAMERA-MOTION-DETECTOR

By help of very basic concepts i have created this motion detector, which detects motion in frames captured by your webcam. 
It's working is very basic it subtracts every frame captured by your camera to the very first frame captured ,after subtracting 
it contour up those new objects found with a green sqare
